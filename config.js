Centuries worth of industrial and chemical activities have led to the accumulation and spread of toxins across metropolitan areas, and New York City is no exception. While a panoply of state and federal programs are charged with investigating and remediating sites that meet a certain threshold of risk to human health, the city is replete with smaller sites that might not qualify for higher level cleanup, but that are contaminated nonetheless. Abandoned gas stations, old factories, landfills, former dry cleaners &mdash; all contain remnants of toxic chemicals and can be considered brownfields.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">In 2007, NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg\'s sweeping sustainability plan, known as  PlaNYC 2030, promised to "clean up all contaminated land in New York City" and launched the nation\'s first municipally-funded brownfield cleanup program. Noting that federal and state programs were insufficient to spur the cleanup and redevelopment of the city\'s vast number of brownfields, Bloomberg offered tax breaks, and other perks to private entities willing to clean up and repurpose these problematic properties.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">In its first decade, NYC\'s Voluntary Cleanup Program supported the remediation of almost 400 contaminated properties. But the program\'s targeting of the private sector means that remediation projects cluster in areas undergoing major residential redevelopment, so that while toxicity is widely distributed, cleanup is highly concentrated.</p>' +

  "<p class=\"neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed\">Much of New York City sits on historic fill, often containing various forms of waste. By some estimates, contamination is pervasive, and almost the entire city could be considered a brownfield. PlaNYC 2030 claimed that 7,600 acres across the city \"could suffer from contamination.\" To date, however, there is no official, comprehensive registry of the city\'s hazardous sites. Instead, researchers and planners generally rely on environmental requirements, or “e-designations,” to approximate the location of such sites.</p>" +
  "<p class=\"neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed\">E-designations only cover properties that have been rezoned since 1977. Beginning that year, all new zoning actions &mdash; from expanding or subdividing a single structure, to creating new historic preservation districts, to limiting or increasing the density of residential neighborhoods &mdash; triggered a process known as the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR). If the CEQR flags a property as having potential contamination and/or determines that construction on it will cause  high ambient noise levels, and/or air emissions, that property receives an e-designation, requiring further environmental investigation, and where appropriate, remediation or mitigation.</p>" +
  "<p class=\"neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed\">Here, we mapped 7,200 lots with <span class=\"bg-orange-500 px-1 rounded text-white\">e-designations</span> across the city.</p>" +

  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">Mayor Michael Bloomberg is known for rezoning one-third of New York City. These changes included downzoning residential neighborhoods like Park Slope and Bayside in order to preserve low housing density. More famously, Bloomberg \"upzoned\" formerly industrial areas, shifting land uses from manufacturing to residential and commercial and lifting building height and density restrictions.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">Upzonings transformed neighborhoods like Williamsburg/Greenpoint, Long Island City, parts of West Harlem, Dumbo, downtown Brooklyn, and West Chelsea. Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the trend continued with upzonings in East New York, Downtown Far Rockaway, East Harlem, Jerome Avenue, Inwood, and Gowanus. Upzonings provide a motor for both market-rate and affordable (privately-owned, subsidized) housing development.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">We mapped 62 <span class="border border-slate-800 px-1 rounded">upzonings</span> that took effect between 2003 and 2019.</p>' +
  "</div>";

let divChapter4 =
  '<div class="text-gray-800 p-6"><p class="fort-font text-left text-base">Where does cleanup happen?</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">In formerly industrial neighborhoods, upzonings lead to an especially large number of e-designated properties that require environmental remediation before they can be redeveloped. To ensure that remediation costs do not hinder redevelopment, PlaNYC 2030 created its own set of brownfield incentives, known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP). In addition to a streamlined process that bypasses lengthy City Council or Community Board approvals,&#42; the VCP allows owners to deduct cleanup costs from their federal taxes and offers assistance with environmental investigation, remediation and certification. Once a VCP project completes final certification, its owners (and their lenders) receive liability protection, guaranteeing that neither the state nor the city will require further investigation or remedial work at the site.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">We identified <span class="bg-teal-600 text-white px-1 rounded">383 VCP sites</span> that were completed between 2009 and 2019. Although they can be found throughout the five boroughs, the vast majority are located in areas that were <span class="border border-slate-800 px-1 rounded">upzoned</span> during the same period.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-sm italic max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">&#42;The VCP does require project approval from the NYC Office of Environmental Remediation (OER).</p>' +

  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">During New York City\'s industrial heyday, from the mid 1800s until the mid 20th century, the Greenpoint/Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn was dominated by oil refineries, tanneries, canning and copper manufacturing plants. At one time, the shores of the Newtown Creek (which borders northeastern Greenpoint) housed 50 petroleum refineries. Over decades, as much as 30 million gallons of oil spilled or leaked into the soil and groundwater in Greenpoint, forming a petroleum plume beneath local businesses and residences. The oil also leached into Newtown Creek, where it mixed with raw sewage, garbage and other toxic chemicals. In 2010, Newtown Creek became the City\'s largest federal Superfund site.</p>' +
  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">Despite the area\'s toxic legacies, in 2005, the City Council agreed to a massive zoning overhaul of Greenpoint and neighboring Williamsburg.  In total, 184 blocks on or near the waterfront were upzoned and rezoned from manufacturing to commercial and residential uses.&#42;</p>' +

  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-sm italic max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">&#42;In an effort to retain some manufacturing jobs, the rezoning also established several mixed-use zones, meant to combine residential and light industrial uses.</p>' +

  '<div class="text-gray-800 p-6"><p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">Thanks mainly to the rezoning, approximately 193 properties in Greenpoint have received <span class="bg-orange-500 px-1 rounded text-white">e-designations</span>.

  "<p class=\"neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed\">Port Richmond is one of New York City\'s oldest industrialized neighborhoods. In 1922, Port Richmond contained 175 industrial plants employing approximately 35,000 workers.

  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">Throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s, globalization and automation caused many of the factories to downsize or close.

  '<p class="neue-font text-left text-base max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">Eventually, municipal services replaced some of Port Richmond\'s empty factories. For example, the neighborhood currently houses a wastewater treatment plant, two private waste transfer stations, and a number of ship repair yards, auto body shops, and salvage yards.
